### ðŸ”¹ **Project Title:** Minions Graphics Animation using C++

### ðŸ“„ **Description:**

This project is a fun **graphics-based C++ program** that draws animated Minions characters using the **Turbo C++ graphics library** (`graphics.h`). It creatively combines basic shapes like lines, arcs, ellipses, and circles to render a detailed visual of Minions on the screen.

The program demonstrates:

* Use of low-level graphic primitives
* Animated drawing using delays
* Classic Turbo C++ environment handling with `initgraph()`, `getmaxx()`, `getmaxy()`, `delay()`, and `closegraph()`

---

### âœ… **Key Highlights:**

* Draws detailed Minion characters using only code
* Demonstrates `graphics.h` functionalities like `arc()`, `ellipse()`, `line()`, `circle()`
* Includes basic animation using `delay()`
* Great example of **C++ graphics programming** for beginners

Let me know if you'd like a modern version using libraries like **SFML** or **OpenGL**!
